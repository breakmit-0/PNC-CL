function [P,width] = corridor(vertexset,path,obstacles,n)
% corridor - The function to compute the safety corridors corresponding to the chosen path, depending on the distance between the path and the obstacles  [<a href="matlab:web('https://breakmit-0.github.io/')">online docs</a>]
    % 
    %
    % Usage:
    %   [P,width] = corridor(VertexSet,path,obstacles,smooth_number)
    %
    % Parameters:
    %   vertexset should be a VertexSet object which contains the coordinates
    %   of the points of the graph in the D-dimensionnal workspace. [G, VertexSet] 
    %   are the returned values by graphBuilder.buildGraph. 
    %
    %   path should be the array which describes the l points of the chosen path. 
    %   [path, dist] are the returned values by shortestpath.
    %
    %   Obstacles should be an array of N Polyhedron object of dimension D
    % 
    %   smooth_number should be a scalar. It is mainly used to have smooth 
    %   corridors extremities.
    %
    % Return Values:
    %   P is an array of l polyhedra which represent the safety corridors
    %   width is the width of the path : it's the width of the narrowest
    %   corridor of the path.
    %
    %   Warning - For now, the function only works in 2D and 3D cases ! -
