%% Description:
%   Here comes a description.

%% Custom heading:
%   If a header line starts with two '%%' symbols, then the next word(s) 
%   will be used as a heading in the html site. The following text with one
%   '%' at the start, like here, will appear underneath. The combination of
%   a descriptor and the text is called a "block". It ends with an empty 
%   line, a line with two '%%' or a line of code. You do not need to use
%   any of the names / blocks shown here.

%% Input:

%% Properties:
%   Class files automatically generate headings for properties and methods,
%   where the properties and methods of that class will be listed. However,
%   the list might be not descriptive enought for your purposes. You can
%   use a second "Properties" heading to write clarifications, e.g.:
%
%   opts - options structure: struct
%       Structure that must be given when calling the class file:
%       opts1 - first option: [double vector ]
%       opts2 - second option: logical

%% ToDo / Changelog
% - because the ToDo is seperated by an empty line from the rest of the
%   header (and there is no block for it in the template), this list will
%   not be on the final html page.
