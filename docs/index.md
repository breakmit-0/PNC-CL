# Path Planning using Convex Lifting

## About

The purpose of this toolbox is to find a path in an environnment with obstacles, in any number of dimensions, using 
the [Convex Lifting]() method.

This toolbox requires [MPT]() and [tbxmanager]().



## Usage

documentation is available [here](https://breakmit-0.github.io/lift-ppl/)


### In Matlab

## Building

### Documentation

This documentation is built with `mkdocs`, the following python packages are required:

* `mkdocs`
* `pymdown-extensions`
* `pygments`


run ` mkdocs build`  to build html documentation in `site/`
and `mkdocs serve` to build and serve on `localhost`
