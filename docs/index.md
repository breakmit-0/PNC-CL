# Path Planning using Convex Lifting

## About

The purpose of this toolbox is to find a path in an environnment with obstacles, in any number of dimensions, using 
the [Convex Lifting]() method.

This toolbox requires [MPT]() and [tbxmanager]().



## Usage

documentation is available [here](https://breakmit-0.github.io/lift-ppl/)
